# AMATH582_Homeworks
A collection of assignments from class AMATH582. 

*Homework 1: Process noisy ultrasound data through method of averaging and use the Fourier Transformation to record the trajectory of a ball stuck in a theoretical dog. 
*Homework 2: Exploration of the Gabor Transformation by varying the window size, time slide, etc. Also recreates the score of a simple song (Mary has a Little Lamb) played on a piano and recorder. 
*Homework 3: Uses the Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to find the coordinate system of different recordings of an oscillating paint can from different angles. Utillizes methods to track the oscillating paint can. 
*Homework 4: Applies and explores the use of PCA to find the dominant features of a data set of cropped faces. Compares how the PCA fares with cropped and aligned faces against non-cropped and non-aligned faces. Uses classification algorithms such as DecsisionTree, K-Nearest Neighbors and Support Vector Machine with the principal compoenents to classify using low-dimensional dynamics. 
*Homework 5: Utilizes Dynamic Mode Decomposition (DMD) to separate the foreground of a video from its background. Compares the results DMD in different videos.
